# Exploratory 2D/3D Data Visualization using Unity

This is an ongoing research oriented project focused on interactive visualisation of high dimensional datasets using 2D and 3D embeddings.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to enable intuitive exploration of complex datasets by mapping dimensionality-reduced embeddings into interactive 2D and 3D environments.

## Core Concepts
- Dimensionality reduction using UMAP
- Deep feature extraction using ResNet50
- Interactive exploration using a 3D Galaxy based metaphor in Unity

## Technology Stack
- Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- Dimensionality reduction UMAP
- Unity 3D (C#)
- Data visualization and interaction design

## Current Work
- Refining spatial mapping of clusters in 3D
- Improving interaction techniques for dataset exploration
- Preparing comparative analysis between 2D and 3D representations

## Research Relevance
Relevant for research in:
- Information Visualisation
- Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Exploratory Data Analysis

## Status
Ongoing research prototype
