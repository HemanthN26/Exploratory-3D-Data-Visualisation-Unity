# Development Log – Interactive 3D Visualization System

## Version 1 – Initial Interaction Model
Interaction design:
- Clicking planet → moons expand
- Clicking moon → thumbnails appear

Observation:
This interaction required multiple steps and reduced navigation efficiency.

---

## Version 2 – Improved Interaction Model
Updated design:
- Clicking planet → user enters cluster space
- Clicking moon → thumbnails appear immediately

Reason for change:
Reduced interaction steps and improved spatial understanding.

---

## Current Focus
Optimising spatial layout and preparing system for user study evaluation.
